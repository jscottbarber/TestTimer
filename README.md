# TestTimer
A Visual Basic utility used to help timed test takers keep track of time remaining for each question, as well as total time remaining.

This utility can be used to keep track of progress on timed tests where total number of questions and total time are known.  The timer can be set to AutoAdvance Questions in order to keep pace with test and not require the user to press the "Next Question" button.  The alternative is to let the question time go into the negative and when the "Next Question" button is pressed, the Question time is recalculated by dividing the remaining time by the remaining number of questions.
